# GDC Converter

An addon for the Pandemonium Engine to help with turning gdscript and scenes directly to engine side c++.

It adds new entries to the editor's tool menu.

It works best with typed gdscript, also it's not perfect.

It however does give you mostly okay results.

This was developed in the broken seals repository. The original dev commits can be found [here](https://github.com/Relintai/broken_seals/commits/master/game/addons/gdc_converter).
